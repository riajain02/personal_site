Researching autonomous surgical robotics for augmented dexterity for surgical subtasks using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK).

- Designed optimization framework for placement of sutures along wounds to optimize forces. Wrote a linear programming formulation, designed constraints, and evaluated pipeline on physical and synthetic splines. In collaboration with Intuitive Surgical.
- Implemented visual servoing algorithm using classic vision techniques for surgical knot-tying. Co-authored publication at IROS.
- Integrated VLM-based querying system to refine semantic understanding of 3D scenes built from Structure-from-Motion pipelines.
