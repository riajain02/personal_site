I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR). I am currently an undergraduate researcher in Professor Ken Goldberg's AUTOLab, where I am working on various projects in computer vision and robotics. In the past, I interned at NVIDIA, where I worked on LLM inference optimization.
