I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in Professor Ken Goldberg's [AUTOLab](https://autolab.berkeley.edu/), where I am working on various projects in computer vision and robotics. In the past, I interned at NVIDIA, where I worked on LLM inference optimization.
